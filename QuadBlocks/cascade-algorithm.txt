all garbage blocks have a position in the 2-D array 'blocks'.

each garbage block also has a list of up to three blocks it's connected to.

those blocks have positions, which, if you add (-.5, -.5), gives you their row and column


when a piece is added to the garbage...

for each block in the piece {
  create a new connected blocks list
  add each other block to the connected blocks list
}
check for line clears



after a line clear...
  start cascade

during a cascade...
  continue or end cascade


start cascade...

clear the recursive gravity table, and mark all spaces as tbd
for each block, starting with the bottom row {
  if the block is marked 'tbd' {
    if there is no block there {
      mark it as empty
    }
    else if there is no position below it, or the position below is marked 'static' {
      mark it as static
      find its connected blocks.
      for each connected block {
        mark as static
      }
    }
  }
}

continue cascade...

if there are still positions marked as 'tbd' {
  for each position that's still marked 'tbd', starting with bottom row {
    if the position is above an 'empty' position {
      decrease the block's Y position by 1
      mark the bottom position as 'tbd'
      mark the top position as 'empty'
    }
    else {
      mark the position as 'static'
      find its connected blocks
      for each connected block {
        mark as static
      }
    }
  }
}
else {
  end cascade
  check for line clears
}



when a block is cleared...

find its connected blocks.
for each connected block {
  remove the cleared block from the connected blocks list
}
delete its connected blocks list




EXAMPLE:

'O' = tbd
'#" = static
' ' = empty

0. start
OOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOO

1. bottom row
OOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOO
## #######

2. second row. one block still 'tbd'
OOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOO
##O### ###
## #######

3. third row. two new blocks still 'tbd'. rightmost is connected to obstructed blocks
OOOOOOOOOO
##O ##O ##
##O### ###
## #######

4. fourth row - part 1. first two blocks marked static, next two as 'tbd'.
##OOOOOOOO
##O ##O ##

5. fourth row - part 2. 5th block and its connected blocks marked as static
##OO..OOOO      ##OO##OOOO
##O #.. ##  =>  ##O ### ##
##O### ###      ##O### ###
## #######      ## #######

6. fourth row - part 3. 8th block would remain 'tbd', except its connected 9th block is 'static'
##OO## OOO      ##OO## ..O      ##OO## ##
